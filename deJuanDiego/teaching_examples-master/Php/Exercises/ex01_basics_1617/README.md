##Exercise 1: Aritmetic Operatos and Variables
...

Write a script to reproduce the output below.  

Manipulate only one variable using  simple arithmetic operators to produce the values given in the statements.  

Hint: In the script each statement ends with "Value is now $variable."  

Value is now 8.  
Add 2. Value is now 10.  
Subtract 4. Value is now 6.  
Multiply by 5. Value is now 30.  
Divide by 3. Value is now 10.  
Increment value by one. Value is now 11.  
Decrement value by one. Value is now 10.  

##Exercise 2: Variable content
...

When you are writing scripts, you will often need to see exactly what is inside your variables.  

For this PHP exercise, think of the ways you can do that, then write a script that outputs the following, using the echo statement only for line breaks.  

string(5) "Harry"  
Harry  
int(28)  
NULL  

##Exercise 3: If Statement
...

Write a script that gets the current month and prints one of the following responses, depending on whether it's August or not:  

It's August, so it's really hot.  
Not August, so at least not in the peak of the heat.  

**Note:** You must use php date() function  

##Exercise 4: Loops I
...

In this PHP exercise, you will put all the loops through their paces. Write a script that will print the following to the browser:  

abc abc abc abc abc abc abc abc abc  

xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz  

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  

1. Item A
2. Item B
3. Item C
4. Item D
5. Item E
6. Item F

Create the 'abc' row with a while loop, the 'xyz' row with a do-while loop, and the last two sections with for loops. Remember to include HTML and source code line breaks in your output. No arrays allowed in this solution.  

##Exercise 5: Loops II
..

Create a 10 x 10 table where the background color is gray for even rows and red for odd rows. The cells' dimensions must be 50x50 (pixels)
